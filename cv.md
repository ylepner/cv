### About

I’m a Full Stack Developer with 1+ year of professional experience and have been focused on learning web development since 2021. <br> 
Over the past 4 years, I’ve immersed myself in web development, gaining hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. <br>
I’ve explored various frameworks and technologies in web development, building projects with vanilla JS and Angular, and completing courses in Node.js and backend technologies. <br> 
I successfully passed an internship as a ServiceNow Developer at EPAM Systems in Gdańsk in 2022, where I studied ServiceNow development based on JavaScript. <br>
In 2023, I focused on React, and in 2024, I transitioned into a Full Stack Developer role. <br>
I now work remotely as part of a team on a project based in Argentina that helps Spanish-speaking users schedule, book, and attend online sessions with psychologists. <br>
I contribute to both frontend and backend development, with a strong focus on usability, responsiveness, and code quality.
