### About

I'm an enthusiastic learner who recently completed courses in JavaScript, Angular, and Node.js. My passion for web development led me to successfully complete an internship program for a ServiceNow Developer position at Epam Systems in Gdansk. I am now eager to embark on a career in Front-End Development.
I have a background in law, which has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. My focus is now on pursuing a fulfilling career in web development, and I look forward to contributing to innovative projects.
