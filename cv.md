### About

I am an enthusiastic learner who has been actively engaged in web development since 2019, dedicating the last four years to honing my skills in various aspects of web development. Recently, I completed courses in JavaScript, Angular, and Node.js, further solidifying my knowledge and expertise in this field. My passion for web development led me to successfully complete an internship program for a ServiceNow Developer position at EPAM Systems in Gdansk. I am now eager to embark on a career in Front-End Development.<br>
I have a background in law, which has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. My focus is now on pursuing a fulfilling career in web development, and I look forward to contributing to innovative projects.
