### About

An enthusiastic learner who has been actively engaged in web development since 2020.<br>
Over the past three years, I have actively immersed myself in the world of web development, cultivating a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and TypeScript.<br>
My educational journey includes completing courses in JavaScript, Angular, and Node.js, enhancing my proficiency in these essential technologies.<br>
My commitment to continuous learning and hands-on experience led me to a successful internship as a ServiceNow Developer at EPAM Systems in Gdansk, where I studied ServiceNow development and administration.<br>
I have a background in law, which has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills.<br>
My focus is now on pursuing a fulfilling career in web development, and I look forward to contributing to innovative projects.
